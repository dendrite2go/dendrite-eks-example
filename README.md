# Dendrite EKS example

Example project that shows how to set up an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster on AWS and run a project based on [archetype-rust-axon](https://github.com/dendrite2go/archetype-rust-axon) on it.

The steps are documented in [doc/aws.md](doc/aws.md). I'm currently stuck at getting the aws-load-balancer-controller to work.
